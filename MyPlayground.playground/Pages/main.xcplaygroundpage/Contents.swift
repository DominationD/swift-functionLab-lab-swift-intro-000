/*: question1
 ### 1. Write a function called `helloWorld()` that prints "Hello, world!" to the console. Then call it to see your string printed to the playground console.
 */
func helloWorld() {
      print("Hello, World!")
}

helloWorld()




/*: question2
 ### 2. Write your own function in which you declare a constant inside the function's body and then print that constant to the console. Call this function to see your string printed to the playground console.
 */
func  blowOff(insult:String){
       print("Are you stupid? You f'n \(insult)!")
}

blowOff(insult: "dickhead")



/*: question3
 ### 3. Write a function that takes a person's name as an argument and prints a greeting to the console. Call it several times with different arguments. What do you think you'll see in the console?
 */
func greeting(name: String){

     print("Hey \(name), I have a bridge in brooklyn for sale.")

}

  greeting(name: "Mike")
  greeting(name: "Jeff")
  greeting(name: "Dave")




/*: question4
 ### 4. Now call the function you wrote in Question 3 using a variable or constant instead of a string literal. What do you expect to see in the console? Try passing in a _variable_ you declared (using `var`) as an argument. Then change that variable's value and call your function again. What do you see in the console?
 */
  var newName = "Brock"
  greeting(name: newName)
  newName = "Bill"
  greeting(name: newName)



/*: question5
 ### 5. Write your own function in which you declare a _variable_ (of any type) inside the function's body. Print out this variable to the console from within your function. After you print the variable once, assign a new value to this variable on the next line. Print it again (after the line on which you assign it to a new value). Call your function several times. What do you expect to see printed to the playground's console each time you call this function?
